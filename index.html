                            of unfiltered humbling. Let me back up and tell you about the time my professor had to put
                            me in a place
                            where I would move on to so clearly see my career purpose.</span>

                        <span><b>Scene:</b> Junior year, Principles of Marketing course, University
                            of North Carolina at Greensboro. We were assigned a group project
                            where the premise was to create a product and develop a very detailed marketing plan for
                            said product.
                            This marketing plan included a budget, mission statement, and product break down you know
                            the usual.</span></p>
                            </div>

                            <div class="col-md-6">
                        <p><span><b>Background:</b> Well as most college projects go, our group was selected for us by personal
                            selection of the professor. And again
                            as most college projects go you inevitably have the person who does nothing,
                            the person who over-achieves, and the people who are there to agree with any task assigned
                            by the overachiever.</span></p>

                           <p><span> Unfortunately at this stage in my educational journey I was the person in the group who
                            seeked to overachieve and by that effect
                            I usually took lead and dispersed task as they came. What was different about this group
                            was the fact that there were two overachievers instead of one which lead to
                            a collapse in the normal college project heirarchy.</span></p>
                    
               

                
                    <p>
                        <span>In an effort to minimize a tale that holds a range of minute details I will get
                            to the main points. As we battled from beginning to end on the product we would create, our
                            mission statement, and the overall presentation it became very clear at one point that this group-ship would
                            ultimately lead to a giant discourse
                            most likely resulting in a failing grade. </span>
                        </p>
                    
                    
                            <p><span> We finally arrived at the most effective
                            route and that was to involve our professor
                            who could act as the guiding light. It was in this meeting that I not only learned proper
                            conflict management but I also learned that my Type A personality
                            can be off-putting. The reason this advise worked was because we both needed to hear it.
                            We both had never been in a situation where we could not take entire control of a project
                            and the moment had finally come.
                        </span>

                            <b>Conclusion:</b> This experience does have a productive and life-changing ending
                            in that not only were two Type A's able to reconcile we ended the project with an A
                            and a second place prize. This summary of one of the most influential moments in my college
                            career has
                            successfully molded me into the leader I am today.
