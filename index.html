                        <span><b>Interest:</b> Something that has been at the top of my list of interest
                        since junior year of college is travel. Traveling has fostered an unmentionable amount 
                        of growth in not only my personal life but also within my career. 
                        I had the opportunity to work in Jordan and experience an entirely different cultural work environment.

                        <p>Outside of work opportunities I gotten the opportunity to travel to places such as France, Hong Kong, Thailand, and Dubai to name a few of my favorites.
                            Some of my other interest include dancing of which I use as a way to unwind from weekly stress, I love reading
                            and reading.</p>
                        </span></p>

                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <p><span><b>Background:</b> 
                        With a degree in International Business, experience working abroad, and 
                        extensive management experience I am confident in my ability to transition 
                        into a Project Management role. 

                        <P>Having little to no experience in content writing I relied on my
                            passion for writing and resilience to land a content marketing role abroad. 
                            It was in this position that I learned how to work in an environment that was culturally 
                            different than anything I have had the opportunity to take part in. It was in Jordan
                            that I learned how to communicate through language barriers, set my own project managemnt schedules,
                            and work with very high-end clients on  very short deadlines.</P>

                        <P>From there I moved into retail management when I learned how to not only manage a team
                            but actively forecast store trends in order to heighten consumer purchase. It was 
                            in this role that I developed the desire to work in tech.</P>

                        <P>My aspirations for working in tech turned into a Product Specialist role with Wix.com
                            where I was able to expand my knowledge as well as advance rather rapidly. I went from Product specialist 
                            to Communications Lead for Wix video, and a team lead shortly after. </P>
                        
                        <P>Leading off of my work experience I was motivated to take a Web Development course in order to 
                            navigate further into the world of tech. Within this course I learned SQL, javascript, MongoDB
                            and React skills that I can now use within any new roll.</P>

                        <P>My career so far shows that I am not afraid to take risk and learn new skills, I am now looking for a 
                            environment where I can actively use a culmination of all the skill I have mastered thus far.</P>
